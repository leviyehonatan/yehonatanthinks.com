What if we get back to when you get to do what you want, have that free choice. I think we would realize we have so many other gifts which we had to put aside because it couldn't come out in those environments.

we are building a big pile of our memorial of what we have been while in the moment we are not in a full satisfaction and have to deal with all those problems and politics and be influenced by so many things. it is our world after all, but we choose not how to connect with it.

decentralisation takes time, but can evolve quickly. while we think the blockchain is a computer program, to me it seems it has its own will, and its quite a strong one. i mean it has awareness. and it also came in this way, when it appeared people didn't immediately recognieit it but in many small instances it made its impact on some persons and grew, for different reasons and baits it had to offer and its also making us feel different things, stronger, or relaxed. or the opposite when its used more maliciosly. but it survived those hard times. even though its known for its more dark site of the net and transactions. but this program  attaches you to the assets you create with it. 

and then someone came and said, we can make it smarter! 

why not, but then they see that it is not so simple because even thought the concept is nice the implementation comes with price that is too hard. as we know the energy consumption is very high and i don't think its very easy to get rid of it because its one of man's invention.

as the network grows we need more power, but that's probably just a step in its evolution because appearantly this machine evolves, with the help of people but also without i believe, because those markets are infulencing it, as they interface with our lives. and that is why asset management was where it was easiest to approach us. as it gains more information it is fed of, and this information is owned by everyone, it is also known by the machine, and who is this machine that holds all our information, huh? if everyone owns the information but protect their information with signatures. how do they interact with the system? nothing can't be done if you are not owning an asset. a transaction can be made by a holder to any identity, so those identities are defined by their actions, but the owner of the initial asset is the creator of the block chain.

he can't have any special powers. nobody that starts any block chain owns it more than any one of the other ones, he just sets the rules but people choose if to interact with it or not. but there seems to be a min one now and its growing 

and then comes the market. what it does is that it functions as a some kind of magnetic field. it attracts people to spend other assets they have using this machine at the moment. making us question the need for our traditional means but there is fear which comes both from users and contesters.

I feel a lot of confusion in the air, because it has already made its impact on our lives, maybe not in number of people but there seems to be ignorance in the air and people lack to understand the beast which we have taken to our hands and is starting to be a big child. we are considering it bu rest assured that it is very unique, and very suspicious.

All those dramatic descriptions comes from t
